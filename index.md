### Unemployment statistics by ethnicity, gender and regions in the UK from 2004 to 2018<br>
> **[Project Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Janette-Le/Python1/blob/main/ABC.ipynb)**\
> **Python - Random forest - Gradient boosting**<br>
> *Used library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seabon, sklearn*
> <p align="justify">There are many factors that affect the unemployment rate; on macroeconomic perspectives, it may be the volatility of the economy or the intervention of the government; on microeconomic perspectives, it may depend on age, gender, education level of the employee and local regional economy. This project aims to study which demographic elements have affected the unemployment trend in the UK in the last 15 years.</p>

### Condominium prices in Singapore<br>
> **[Project Link](https://github.com/Janette-Le/R-Singapore-housing-price/blob/main/README.md)**\
> **Tableau**\
> **R - Multiple linear regression - Stepbackward - LASSO - PCR - Classification tree**
> <p align="justify"> This project aims to provide insights and outcomes by analyzing using past data of private residential units, specifically condominiums in Singapore. The factors that affect customer's willingness to buy include the area of the flats, whether it’s a resale or new sale, leasehold of the flat, completion year, et cetera. Developers can use these insights to make pricing decisions for both resale and new flats from observing the willingness to pay of buyers based on historical data.</p>

### Pharmacy Insurance Claims Analysis <br>
> **[Project Link](https://github.com/Janette-Le/SQL-Pharmacy-Insurance-Claims/blob/main/README.md)**\
> **MySQL, Schema**\
> **Snowflake schema, 3NF, Entity-relation model**
> <p align="justify"> This project aims to develope a database management system to store, manipulate and search drug prescriptions of customers, created snowflake schema and transformed data into 3NF. Also, assign Primary, foreign keys and performed SQL queries to insert, update, delete prescription records; designate an Entity-relation model and produced a table to retrieve customer details.</p>

### Wine quality<br>
> **[Project Link](https://github.com/Janette-Le/R-Wine-quality/blob/main/README.md)**\
> **R - Multiple linear regression - Stepwise Regression - LASSO**
> <p align="justify">In general, red wine is a complex mix of a large number of chemicals; there’s no exact figure, but estimates range from around 800 different compounds to over 1000. Each element differently affects the taste of wine, and also regards to its concentration. Using machine learning to explore which are typical elements that make wine taste "good" and their effects.</p>

### MNIST from Scratch<br>
> **[Project Link](https://github.com/Janette-Le/R-MNIST/blob/main/README.md)**\
> **R - Logistic regression - Random forest**
> <p align="justify"> The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. Deloying Logistic regression and Random forests models to comprehensively understand about the effect of each parameter on prediction accuracy.</p>
